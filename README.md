# DikkandeCam: Video Uploader Script

Scans a specified directory for video-image pairs generated by motion detection software. Uploads these pairs to the DikkandeCam server. Deletes the local copies if the server confirms successful upload (after SHA1 comparison).

``` python dikkande-upload.py [watchDirPath] [uploadUrl] ```
